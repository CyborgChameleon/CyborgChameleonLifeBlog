            Hi folks!<br>
            
            This is CyborgChameleon! This is where I keep all of my gathered informations and note on development and where I keep track of all the progresses I have made. So far i have been focused on both webdevelopment and game development. You can follow along or find the links that relevant below. <br><br>
            
            Happy Coding!<br>

            <h4>Basics</h4>
            
            if you're new and not sure if coding is the right thing for you, you can check out sololearn's website where they provided a bite size courses of the basics of the coding langauge of your choice.<br>

            <a href="development/webDev.html"><h4>Web Development</h4></a>
            <p>
            This is probably one of the easiest development that you can do so if you still want to know coding but you don't think you have preseverence for complex stuff or you're doing it for a hobby and not as a full time coder you may follow me <a href="development/webDev.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <a href="development/ccppDev.html"><h4>Development with C/C++</h4></a>
            <p>
            if you're serious about developing powerful stuff like your own operating system or power software to aid you with animation, 3d modeling, games etc, or you're coding for robotics and many other things. then c/cpp is for you because they are widely appllicable. but be warned it has a steep learning curve so be ready to have some sort of dedication if you're not doing this for academic or professional reason. however if you're a student/professional/passionated coder looking to see what i have gathered then feel free to follow me <a href="development/ccppDev.html">here.</a>
            </p>

            <a href="development/3DSDev.html"><h4>3Ds Development</h4></a>
            
            <p>
            im currently coding for 3ds application and internet is a tricky place if you want to take a look of what i have gathered, feel free to take a look <a href="development/3DSDev.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            
            <a href="development/gameDev.html"><h4>Game Development</h4></a>
            <p>
            since i'm still learning to code for 3ds so i'm far from being qualified to learn game development so i'm only bookmarking all the potentially useful sources here. but feel free to browse the sources <a href="development/gameDev.html">here.</a>
