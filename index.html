					<h3>WELCOME!</h3>
					<p>Hi folks!</p>
					<p>
						This is Cyborg Chameleon! 
						This is currently where I organize my life
						so that I can filter out unnecessary garbage
						and focus on important things. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						This website is coded purely in HTML, CSS and JS.
						I wanted to see how far I could go without a framework.
						Which is ideal for me 
						because it forces me to simplify things that I need to work on.
						So if you're a new developer, 
						please thake a look around. 
						This way you can visualize 
						how far one can go with three basic parts of wed developement.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is probably 100th remake 
						due to either my own disatisfication
						or my habits of overcomplicating things.
						There's one thing that I'm grateful is that I still attempted to make a website.
						I looked forward to many years of progress to come.					
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're following for my coding or web related stuff,
						it's currently being moved to another website.
						You'll find them soon on this page once I got it cleaned up.
						I also intended to make each website with their own framework
						so keep your eyes peeled.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, if you find anything that I write inspiring or useful feel free to follow.
					</p>
					<p>
						Happy coding!
					</p>
