            <h3>WELCOME!</h3>
            <p>Hi folks!</p>
            <p>
							This is Cyborg Chameleon! 
							This is one of many websites I make
							and I want to fully understand web development from the basics.
							So I took the opportunity to try to make a website without a framework
							to see how far I can do soley with html, css and js.
							This is currently where I organize my life
							so that I can filter out unnecessary garbage
							and focus on important things. 
							This is ideal for me 
							because it forces me to simplify things that I need to work on.
							So if you're a new developer, 
							please thake a look around. 
							This way you can visualize 
							how far one can go with three basic parts of wed developement.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're following for my coding or web related stuff,
							it's currently being moved to another website.
							You'll find them soon on this page once I got it cleaned up.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, if you find anything that I write inspiring or useful feel free to follow.
						</p>
            <p>
							Happy coding!
						</p>
