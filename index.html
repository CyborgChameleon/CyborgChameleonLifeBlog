            Hi folks!<br>
            
            This is CyborgChameleon! This is my "first" website. like I have made many drafts before making this site but I kept on scraping them because of my own disatisfication or because of my habits of overcomplicating things. I made this website to better organize my developing progress in both coding and other areas of life. Since I have so many things that I wanted to do so I'm using this website to help organize my todo list and help myself focus better and perhaps I may start bookmarking things for myself here instead of other places.<br>
            
            but if you're seeing this it means that I have finally made my website available to the public and feel free to have a look around to see if there's any notes that I have taken be of any use for you.<br><br>
            
            Happy coding!<br>
