This is probably one of the easiest development that you can do so if you still want to know coding but you don't think you have preseverence for complex stuff or you're doing it for a hobby and not as a full time coder you may follow me <a href="development/webDev.html">here</a>.

<p>
if you're serious about developing powerful stuff like your own operating system or power software to aid you with animation, 3d modeling, games etc, or you're coding for robotics and many other things. then c/cpp is for you because they are widely appllicable. but be warned it has a steep learning curve so be ready to have some sort of dedication if you're not doing this for academic or professional reason. however if you're a student/professional/passionated coder looking to see what i have gathered then feel free to follow me <a href="development/ccppDev.html">here.</a>
